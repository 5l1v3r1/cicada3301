# How to setup
It's actually quite simple to add the bot to your server. Just follow these steps:
1. Visit the URL [https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=334227800003313674&scope=bot&permissions=201849937](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=334227800003313674&scope=bot&permissions=201849937).

# Updating the bot
You don't need to update it; the code is running on my server, so updates will be automatically installed (on my server) without needing your interaction. :)
